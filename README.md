## Description

This theme is designed to fit the needs for fire brigades in Austria (Freiwillige Feuerwehren).

## How does it work

Clone this repository into the wp-content/themes folder of you wordpress installation.
There are placeholders in the code markes with `{CHANGE:*.}` *. for regex notation - represents some text that is added to show what the placeholder should be replaced with.
For images I suggest to select the theme first and then just replace it with the visual editor (much simpler and the propper image can be uploaded simultaneously).
Select the theme (wp-fire) - if not done before.

Not create the wanted pages with the content via the admin panel ({url}/wp-admin).
Afterwards you can add those pages in the Navigation-block, that is located in the header.
